# Cosmoria

## What to do if it *doesn't* work...
- Are you running Java 9?
  - It is most likely you're running the wrong version of java (or maybe you're just not running java - hint - you need to), you need java 1.9 or higher - this can be downloaded[here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
- Are you on MacOS? 
  - Running MacOS is fine but because of the way OpenGL works you will have to run it with the command `java -jar -XstartOnFirstThread Cosmoria.jar` (or whatever the .jar file is called)
  - We will (someday) add a launcher for Cosmoria meaning even those on Macs will just be able to double-click it to enjoy spacey goodness.
- Are you using a system that is not one of MacOS, Windows or Linux?
  - Sorry - you're doomed, unless you want to help the gods over at[LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) and add your system to their capabilities? Please?
  
## What to do if it *does* work... (yay!)
- Become a button samurai:
  - Press `ESC` to toggle paused mode (the game starts in this state)
  - Use WASD to move forward, backward etc - you know the drill
  - Use `shift` and `space` to move up and down in that order
  - Use `up` and `down` to fast forward in time (but only kind of)
- In the likely event of a bug:
  - Get it exiled from the game by putting it in our issues tracker [here](https://github.com/Thundernerds/Cosmoria/issues).
